                Face masks are one of the most recognizable and memorable measures put in place to counteract the virus.
                These masks are required in public by many countries around the world, including the Philippines. Our
                government has placed many guidelines and protocols when it comes to these masks. These guidelines also
                include where, when, and how these masks should be worn. Additionally, the Philippine government has
                also required the use of face shields on top of masks.

                To the left, you can see an image of a surgical mask. These are one of the most common masks worn by
                people, especially in the Philippines. They provide sufficient protection if worn properly. Protection
                while
                wearing these masks can be improved if the wearer wears more than one mask and wears many layers of
                protection. Additionally, these masks are one of the preferred masks of surgeons and medical
                professionals.

                Moving on, we see pictures of cloth masks. These masks can protect you from COVID 19, but there are some
                consideration that you need to make when
                choosing to wear a cloth mask. These considerations include:
            <ol>
                <li>Two layers of fabric are recommended for protection</li>
                <li>Making sure that the mask is snug on your face</li>
                <li>Make sure to have a suitable fabric that does not make it hard to breathe.</li>
                <li>Masks that have vents and holes in them should not be worn</li>
            </ol>

                Moving on, we now look at N95 masks. These types of masks provide great protection. However, these
                are<b> not recommended for use by regular civilians.</b> According to the CDC, these masks should be
                prioritized for the use of medical professionals, especially if the mask is labelled 'surgical N95'.

            <p>
                According to the CDC, <b>face shields alone are not recommended as a replacement for masks</b> They have
                very large gaps and let a lot of outside air in. This is to be expected, as they are primarily meant for
                protection of the eyes and face. However, they still have their uses during this pandemic. They can
                especially be used as an addition to masks or for people who have medical issues that make wearing masks
                hard.

            <p>
                Now that you know about the different types of masks, I hope that you can make an informed decision
                about how to protect yourself against COVID. Along with other proactive measures, masks can really play
                a huge part in protecting you if you use them properly. Wear them properly, wear the right ones, and
                wear them whenever you need to. As always, remember to be safe and proactive when it comes to your
                health!

            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure to wear your masks in public! Especially if you have a medical condition, masks are an
                    important layer of self-protection against getting the virus.</li>
                <li>Make sure your masks fit snugly and properly. Make sure there are no gaps where air can leak out,
                    and that your nose is inside the mask.</li>
                <li>Remember that you can adjust your mask within certain limits for comfort. If there are any problems
                    with the fit of your mask, you can adapt and adjust. You can wear multiple layers, wear mask braces,
                    or even tie the straps to find that perfect fit!</li>
            </ul>
